      "An endangered species is a species that is very likely to become extinct in the near future, either worldwide or in a particular political jurisdiction. Endangered species may be at risk due to factors such as habitat loss, poaching, and invasive species.The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List lists the global conservation status of many species, and various other agencies assess the status of species within particular areas. Many nations have laws that protect conservation-reliant species which, for example, forbid hunting, restrict land development, or create protected areas. Some endangered species are the target of extensive conservation efforts such as captive breeding and habitat restoration. Human activity is a significant cause in causing some species to become endangered",

      "Due to climate change, ecosystems are at risk, and animals are facing the threat of extinction. However, it is now crucial to prevent this. Showing concern for endangered species and protecting them can prevent extinction and increase their populations. So, why should we protect endangered species? The National Institute of Ecology cited the example of the dodo bird. The dodo bird, which lived on the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, is already extinct. Living on an uninhabited island without natural predators, the dodo bird's wings degenerated, turning it into a ground-dwelling bird. However, one day, the uninhabited island where the dodo bird lived was discovered by Portuguese sailors, who indiscriminately hunted the birds. Subsequently, Mauritius became a stopover for passing ships, and with each new arrival, dodo birds were captured, eventually disappearing from the Earth forever. The dodo bird became the first animal documented as extinct due to human activity. However, the problem did not end there. In 1992, at the Rio Environmental Conference in Brazil, it was reported that the Calvaria tree on Mauritius, where the dodo bird lived, ceased reproducing and became an endangered species after the dodo's extinction. According to scholars, the dodo bird played a crucial role in dispersing the seeds of the Calvaria tree through its consumption and excretion. After the extinction of the dodo bird, the seeds could no longer germinate. This illustrates how one species can be part of a complex web of symbiotic relationships involving dozens of other species. Some of these species are essential for human survival. A significant example is the raw material for Tamiflu, readily available in pharmacies, which comes from plants. It has been reported that no other species, except the plant using the spice known as Star Anise, can replace this plant as a source for Tamiflu. If this plant becomes extinct, even a mild flu could lead to hospitalization without a substitute. Additionally, biodiversity can serve as a solution to climate change.",
